**Abstract:** In this article, we identify certain instances of bent functions, constructed using the so-called $P_\tau$ property, that are provably outside the completed Maiorana-McFarland ($\cM^\#$) class.This also partially answers an open problem in posed by Kan {\em et al.} (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, doi: 10.1109/TIT.2022.3140180. (2022)).	We show that this design  framework (using the $P_\tau$ property),  can provide instances of bent functions that are outside the known classes of  bent functions, including the classes  $\cM^\#$, $\cC,\cD$ and $\cD_0$, where  the latter three were introduced by Carlet in the early nineties. We provide two generic methods for identifying such instances, where most notably one of these methods uses permutations that may admit  linear structures. For the first time, a set of sufficient conditions for the functions of the form  $h(y,z)=Tr(y\pi(z)) + G_1(Tr_1^m(\alpha_1y),\ldots,Tr_1^m(\alpha_ky))G_2(Tr_1^m(\beta_{k+1}z),\ldots,Tr_1^m(\beta_{\tau}z))+ G_3(Tr_1^m(\alpha_1y),\ldots,Tr_1^m(\alpha_ky))$  to be bent and outside $\cM^\#$ is specified without a strong assumption that the components of the permutation $\pi$ do not admit linear structures.
