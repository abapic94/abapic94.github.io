I completed and successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis entitled “Constructing New Superclasses of Bent Functions and Further Constructions of Cryptographically Significant Mappings Outside M#” in December 2022 at the University of Primorska. My doctoral research was supervised by Prof. Enes Pasalic, with Dr. Samir Hodžić as co-supervisor.

I am currently working as a high school mathematics teacher in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In addition, I serve as an Honorary Lecturer at the DIPLOMA Hochschule, where I teach basic higher-level mathematics for industrial engineering students, covering topics in calculus and linear algebra.

Although I am formally retired from active academic research, I continue to contribute to the scientific community through peer reviewing and by remaining engaged with developments in my research field.
