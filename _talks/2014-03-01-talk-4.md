Popular talk for Mathematics Students at the Department of Mathematics University of Tuzla.


**Abstract:** One of the more important properties of Boolean functions, which are used in cryptographic algorithms, is its nonlinearity. Of great importance are those whose nonlinearity is maximal. We will define those functions and list some of their characterizations (using Walsh-Hadamard transform, Cayley graphs...) as well as their applications.
